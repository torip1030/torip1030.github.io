This is a coding assessment to display my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

This simple web page allows the user interact with two buttons. The first button creates rows saying hello. The second button creates rows saying goodbye. ONE event listener is used to implement the functionality of both buttons. 

This project is compatible for latest Chrome, IE 10 & 11, Edge, latest Safari and is flexible for both mobile and desktop layouts.

This simple web page is currently hosted at https://torip1030.github.io/
